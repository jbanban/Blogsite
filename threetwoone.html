    "Tatlo, Dalawa, Isa" is a compilation of three intimate stories directed by Filipino 
cinema legend Lino Brocka. The films show the perseverance of hope despite a sense of despair.
Featuring a drug addict, an abandoned daughter and a repressed catholic.

Award-winning director Lino Broka's hadworks is evident in each of the dramatic treasures included in this anthology. 
Three seperate stories about people who, in different ways, seek a way out of the lives they have become trapped in. 
In the first installment, "Mga Hugis sa Pag-Asa", we follow a young drug addict, Noni, as he struggles through a drug 
rehabilitation program and also tries to come to terms with issues regarding his parentage. The second film, 
"Hellow, Soldier", tells the story of Gina, a GI baby who arranges a meeting with her American father in the hopes 
that he will take her away from the squalor of the slums where she lives, even if it means leaving her birth mother 
behind. The final story, "Bukas, Madilim. Bukas" concerns the frustrations of Rosalinda, a good Catholic daughet who 
has given up her own life and dreams to tend to her domineering, ailing mother.

Three separate stories abaout peoople who, in different ways, seek a way out of the lives they have become trapped in. The first is a drug addict in rehab, in the second, a GI baby arranges a meeting with her American father, the final story is a good Catholic daughter who has given up her own life to care for her ailing mother.
A dialectic tension between immediate generations is at work in this portmanteau film composed of three stories. Three unrelated stories that demonstrate different yet predictable outcomes, underscoring director Lino Brocka’s predilection for neat, schematic endings. Working with three different scenarists, Brocka directs all three segments, taking on this project after the success of his much-praised masterwork, Tinimbang Ka Ngunit Kulang, which was released earlier in the same year.


<img src="assets/img/tto/hugisngpagasa.jpg" alt="Mga hugis ng Pag-Asa">
In Mga Hugis ng Pag-asa, Noni undergoes the arduous pains of rehabilitation in a center for drug reformers. While it touches on Noni’s familial and filial problems and his subsequent descent into drug use, the film spotlights the almost inhuman, almost dubious methods the center utilizes to turn troubled lives around. There is adequate cursing and screaming – and, to a certain extent, release— to recall the unconventional techniques of Arthur Janov and the scenes of sadistic rehabilitation in A Clockwork Orange.
First story is about drug addiction and journey to recovery set in a controversial rehabilitation centre with unique methods of treatments. Highly charged and confrontational with lots of screaming but there's lots of tenderness underneath and genuine care for its characters.

The second entry in this triptych is Hello, Soldier, a compassionate tale that depicts the lives of a mother and a daughter in the slums of Manila and the return of the former’s American soldier lover. It’s 1963, 17 years after they last parted ways at the end of the Second World War, and his return is meant to formalize his adoption of their daughter, Gina (Hilda Koronel). She is a willing would-be adoptee, dreaming of all things American—her bedroom walls covered with pinned Americana— and being lifted out of a life of poverty. On the day of his visit, with his American wife, Lucia, Gina’s mother, chooses to get drunk for the first time. The obvious and strident overtones of colonialist legacy – and the specters of neo-colonialism—are in evidence here, most especially in Lucia’s drunken anti-American tirade (a great bravura performance by Anita Linda).
Second story is a social realist melodrama. This is Brocka in his elements and this is the best of the three. A look into slum life, the American influence on Filipinos and the lure of the American Dream.

In the final episode of this omnibus, Bukas, Madilim, Bukas, the limits of self-sacrifice are tested by matriarchal tyranny in an old Spanish family. Atang, (played with just the right measure of stricture by Mary Walter), the seemingly crippled matriarch, controls her household with an iron fist. Her despotic control of her household sees her daughter, Rosenda (played superbly with conflicted nuance by Lolita Rodriguez), devoting her life to nursing her mother. No househelp, let alone any outsider, is welcome unless the old woman approves it. Enter Miguelito (Mario O’Hara), the gardener, a seemingly guileless youth from the province who befriends Rosenda and awakens her sexuality. This narrative reverses the filial dynamics in Karoly Makk’s Szerelem (Love) and hints at noirish elements of intrigue and seduction. 
Third story is like Brocka trying his hands at gothic drama. A tale of intra-family issues, parental manipulation/possessiveness and sexual repression. It has great flow to it with a really nice gothic atmosphere.
